Abstract

The best way to predict the future is to study past behavior. With the help of data analysis, we are studying about the features of the different models of 
cameras released from 1994 to 2007.We have gathered information about the various features of the camera models like the Release date, Max resolution, 
Low resolution, Effective pixels, Zoom wide, Zoom tele, Normal focus range, Macro focus range, Storage, Weight, Dimensions and Price of the camera models. 
We have performed data cleaning  by replacing the missing numeric data  with mean values of the respective features of the dataset and also we have fixed the 
types and inconsistent capitalization .We have used various graph visualization techniques to study and analyze our dataset. They include bar chart, histogram, 
box plot, line graph and scatter plot. We have used boxplot to filter the unwanted outliers of numeric data from our dataset. The concept of normalization 
was used to reduce data redundancy and improve data  integrity. Hypothesis testing has helped us in estimating the mean values of the various numeric features 
of our dataset by choosing random samples from the respective features of the dataset. We also wanted to check the relationship between the various features 
of our dataset. With the help of these methods of data analysis we were able to study about the variation of the features of the different models of cameras 
over the years.


Introduction

A camera is an optical instrument used to record images. At their most basic, cameras are sealed  boxes with a small hole (the aperture) that allow light in 
to capture an image on a light-sensitive surface. We have considered the different problem statement on our dataset like 1. We have found the growth in the 
production of camera on every year. 2. We have considered the price and release date features to fix the outliers. 3.  We have considered the price of camera 
to see the growth in it. In this way we have used the camera dataset to study about the various features of the camera models.

In our project, we have taken a dataset which consists of various camera models with their release dates ranging from the year 1994 to 2007.We have performed 
various techniques to analyse the dataset like Data cleaning, Data visualisation, Normalisation, Hypothesis testing and Correlation. We have cleaned the 
dataset by relacing the null values with the mean value of the respective columns(features). We have done Data visualisation by plotting various graphs. 
We have done the Hypothesis testing on three of the features of our dataset. We have also normalised the data by making the mean and variance of each numeric 
column to 0 and 1 respectively. We have also performed the correlation of each pair of possible features of our dataset.


Dataset

	Our camera dataset shows us about the different features of the different camera models released from 1994 to 2007.We have taken this dataset 
	from 
	the source: www.kaggle.com repository. This dataset consists of 1038 observations and 13 features which are:
  
•	The Categorical Variables are Model.

•	The Discrete Numerical Variables are Max resolution, Low resolution, Effective pixels, Zoom wide, Zoom tele, Normal focus range, Macro focus range, 
Storage, Weight, Dimensions and Price.

•	The Continuous numerical variables are Release Date.

The percentage of missing values in our dataset is 5%.
